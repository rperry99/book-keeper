## Thoughts

I really don't know how practical a bookmarking website is. HOWEVER. I can see this functionality being useful as a feature within a website. The website [Board Game Geek](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/) uses this feature. There is a "Quickbar" at the top where you can add your own custom links (within BGG), to different pages. This makes it easy to go to different parts of the website. I actually use this feature pretty extensively on there.
